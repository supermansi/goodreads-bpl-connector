## What

A Goodreads -> BPL connector.

I wanted to figure out a way for checking if any of the books I've shelved on Goodreads are available at the Boston Public Library either in the Central location or E-Book for Kindle. This script checks my profile for the shelf and fetches all the titles. Then for each title, it checks if either of the desired formats are available.

A random side project for a thought I've had for a while.
